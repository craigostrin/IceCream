TODO: different flavors of ice cream for each level, make them unique i guess

notes: big range of bullet speed makes for some very hard patterns, hard to follow (fun for a one-off or special level maybe. also consider giving the extra fast creams they're own color)

-----------------LEVEL 1-----------------
125/175/1.0/1.0/5.0
Good speed, a little too much gap between creams sometimes
125/175/1.0/1.0/3.0
Probably good

LEVEL 2
150/200/same rates
Get used to faster bullets before increasing fire rates

LEVEL 3
same speed/1.0/0.75/3.0
seems good but 2.75 max feels better, less open space
150/200/1.0/0.75/2.75

LEVEL 4
150/200/0.5/0.75/2.75

LEVEL 5
150/200/0.5/0.5/2.25
feels like the first challenging level

BONUS LEVEL: sudden death (if you die, go straight to the next level)
100/400/0.5/0.5/2.5

LEVEL 6 - lets speed up again (EASY-ISH)
200/250/0.5/0.5/2.5

LEVEL 7
200/250/0.4/0.5/2



----------------MAX LEVEL-----------------
500/600/0.1/0.2/1.0
- pretty good! maybe a tad too fast
